This project is a meta-analysis on the various viral genome assembly software that is available to researchers. I will be looking at about 100 researh articles that have been peer reviewed, collect information on the software used to complete the research. 

The type of information that will be collected is as follows:

  1.The articles must be peered-reviewed
  
  2. contain the following keywords in the titles or body:
  
    a) virus
    
    b) assembly, assembler, assembled
    
    c)genome
    
    d)algorithm
    
  2.If the software was designed with one of the following algorithms
  
    a) De Bruijn
    
    b) Hybrid
    
    c)Greedy-Extension
    
    d)OLC
  
  3.If the software is de novo or not
  
The objective is to determine which algorithm is mostly used to sequence viral genomones. This is a significant study due to possible pandemics, diseases, and ilnesses that a virus can cause. The response time of governments,scientists, pharmaceutical companies and other corporations are very important. Therefore being able to know what algorithms to seqeunce new viral genomes is important. 


# Results 

There were 91 articles analyzed and a total of 81 different software names. The main trend that is seen is that the De Bruijn algorithm is the most used out of the 4 classical algorithms (Overlap-Layout Cencus, De Bruijn, Greedy-Extension andHybrid). Figure 2 and 4 show this to be true. In Figure 2, De Bruijn algorithm is used 52% of the time. In Figure 4, ABySS, IDBA, and Velvet are all De Bruijn algorithms and comprise 4/5 of the most popular software analyzed in this study.
